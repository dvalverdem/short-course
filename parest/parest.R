#' ## Introduction
#' 
#' This course focuses on the use of models for understanding, predicting, and controlling ecological and epidemiological systems.
#' Models play a central role in this work because they allow us to precisely and quantitatively express our ideas about mechanisms.
#' To the extent our understanding of the important mechanisms is correct, such models are extremely useful in the design of policy.
#' On the other hand, models are useful in uncovering the important mechanisms, inasmuch as we can compare model predictions to data.
#' Specifically, if we can translate competing hypotheses into mathematical models, these can be compared in terms of their ability to correctly capture the patterns seen in data.
#' 
#' In order to fairly compare competing models, we must first try to find out what is the best each model can do.
#' Practically speaking, this means that we have to find the values of the models' parameters that give the closest correspondence between model predictions and data.
#' Parameter estimation can be challenging even when we are fairly confident in the ability of a single model to explain the dynamics.
#' 
#' ## Working with ordinary differential equation models (ODE)
#' 
#' Here we begin our study of computational techniques for studying epidemiological models. 
#' In this session we introduce the numerical solution (or integration) of nonlinear differential equations using the sophisticated solvers incorporated into **pomp**.
#' Numerical integration is one of the most important tools we have for the analysis of epidemiological models.
#' 
#' ### The SIR model
#' 
#' The classical SIR compartmental model divides a population of hosts into three classes: susceptible, infected, recovered.
#' The model describes how the fraction of a population in each of these classes changes with time.
#' Alternatively, the model can track the number of individuals in each class.
#' Births are modeled as flows from "elsewhere" into the susceptible class; deaths are modeled as flows from the S, I, or R compartment into "elsewhere".
#' If $S$, $I$, and $R$ refer to the fractions of indivduals in each compartment, then these **state variables** change according to the following system of differential equations:
#' $$\begin{aligned}
#' \frac{dS}{dt} &= B-\lambda\,S-\mu\,S\\
#' \frac{dI}{dt} &= \lambda\,S-\gamma\,I-\mu\,I\\
#' \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma\,I-\mu\,R.\\
#' \end{aligned}$$
#' Here, $B$ is the crude birth rate (births per unit time), $\mu$ is the death rate and $\gamma$ is the recovery rate.
#' We'll assume that the force of infection, $\lambda$, has the form
#' $$\lambda = \beta\,I$$
#' so that the risk of infection a susceptible faces is proportional to the *prevalence* (the fraction of the population that is infected).
#' This is known as the assumption of frequency-dependent transmission.
#' Notice that we allow for the possibility of a contact rate, $\beta(t)$, that varies in time.
#' 
#' ### Integration of ordinary differential equations using **pomp**
#' 
#' Like almost all ecological and epidemiological models, one can't solve these equations analytically.
#' However, we can compute the **trajectories** of a continuous-time model such as this one by integrating the equations numerically.
#' Doing this accurately involves a lot of calculation, and there are smart ways and not-so-smart ways of going about it.
#' This very common problem has been very thoroughly studied by numerical analysts for generations so that, when the equations are smooth, well-behaved functions, excellent numerical integration algorithms are readily available to compute approximate solutions to high precision.
#' In particular, **R** has several sophisticated ODE solvers which (for many problems) will give highly accurate solutions.
#' These are harnessed by **pomp**.
#' These algorithms are flexible, automatically perform checks, and give informative errors and warnings.
#' 
#' ### SIR for a closed epidemic
#' 
#' Let's study the SIR model for a closed population, i.e., one in which we can neglect births and deaths.
#' Recall that the differential equations for the closed epidemic are
#' $$\begin{aligned}
#' \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta\,S\,I\\
#' \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta\,S\,I-\gamma\,I\\
#' \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma\,I
#' \end{aligned}$$
#' To incorporate these deterministic equations into a `pomp` object, we supply them to the `pomp` function via the `skeleton` argument as a `Csnippet`.
#' We must also provide a `Csnippet` to initialize the state variables $S$, $I$, and $R$.
#' For example:
## ----closed-sir-model-defn-three-----------------------------------------
library(pomp)

closed.sir.ode <- Csnippet("
  DS = -Beta*S*I/N;
  DI = Beta*S*I/N-gamma*I;
  DR = gamma*I;
")

init <- Csnippet("
  S = N-1;
  I = 1;
  R = 0;
  ")

pomp(data=data.frame(time=1:50,data=NA),
     times="time",t0=0,
     skeleton=closed.sir.ode,
     skeleton.type="vectorfield",
     initializer=init,
     statenames=c("S","I","R"),
     paramnames=c("Beta","gamma","N")) -> closed.sir


#' 
#' Now we can call `trajectory` to compute trajectories of the model.
#' To do this, we'll need some values of the parameters.
#' If we're thinking of a disease something like measles, and measuring time in years, we might use something like:
## ----set-closed-params---------------------------------------------------
params <- c(Beta=1,gamma=1/13,N=763)

#' What is the infectious period of this disease?
#' What is $R_0$ in this case?
#' 
#' Next, we compute a model trajectory with the `trajectory` command and store the result in a data-frame:
## ----solve-closed-sir----------------------------------------------------
x <- trajectory(closed.sir,params=params,as.data.frame=TRUE)


#' and plot the results using the commands:
## ----epi-curve-plot,eval=T-----------------------------------------------
ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I))+geom_line()


#' 
#' #### Exercise: conversion of units
#' Suppose that you'd rather measure time in years.
#' Modify the parameters accordingly and verify your modifications.
#' 
#' Let's study how the epidemic curve depends on the transmission rate, $\beta$, and the infectious period.
#' In particular, we'll investigate how the epidemic curve changes as we vary $\beta$ from 0.05 to 2 and the infectious period from 1 to 8 days.
#' 
## ----nine-curves,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE--------------------------------
expand.grid(Beta=c(0.05,1,2),gamma=1/c(1,2,4,8),N=763) -> params1

x <- trajectory(closed.sir,params=t(params1),as=TRUE,times=seq(0,50))

## ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I,group=traj))+geom_line()

## ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I,group=traj))+geom_line()+scale_y_log10()

library(plyr)
mutate(params1,traj=seq_along(Beta)) -> params1
join(x,params1,by="traj") -> x

ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I,group=traj,
                          linetype=factor(Beta),color=factor(1/gamma)))+
    geom_line()+scale_y_log10(limits=c(1e-3,NA))+
    labs(x="time (da)",color=expression("IP"==1/gamma),
         linetype=expression(beta))


#' 
#' 
#' The ability to numerically integrate ODE is essential, but its power is limited.
#' The next exercise demonstrates the importance of being able to analyze the equations as well.
#' 
#' #### Exercise: exploring the model's dynamical repertoire
#' For each of the above parameter combinations, describe the system's behavior.
#' Compute $R_0$ for each parameter combination and relate it to the behavior of the system.
#' 
#' 
#' #### Exercise: final size
#' Use `trajectory` to study the dependence of the epidemic's **final size**, $f$, on $R_0$.
#' Compare your results with the predictions of the final size equation
#' $$R_0=-\frac{\log{(1-f)}}{f},$$
#' the solution of which is [plotted below](#estimating-r_0-from-the-final-size).
#' 
#' ### SIR dynamics in an open population
#' 
#' Over a sufficiently short time scale, the assumption that the population is closed is reasonable.
#' To capture the dynamics over the longer term, we'll need to account for births and deaths, i.e., allow the population to be an **open** one.
#' As we've seen, if we further assume that the birth rate equals the death rate, then the SIR equations become
#' $$\begin{aligned}
#' \frac{dS}{dt} &= \mu\,N -\beta\,S\,I-\mu\,S\\
#' \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta\,S\,I-\gamma\,I-\mu\,I\\
#' \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma\,I-\mu\,R\\
#' \end{aligned}$$
#' 
#' We must modify the ODE function accordingly:
## ----open-sir-model-defn-------------------------------------------------
open.sir.ode <- Csnippet("
  DS = -Beta*S*I/N+mu*(N-S);
  DI = Beta*S*I/N-gamma*I-mu*I;
  DR = gamma*I-mu*R;
")

init <- Csnippet("
  S = S_0;
  I = I_0;
  R = N-S_0-I_0;
")

pomp(data=data.frame(time=seq(0,20,by=1/52),cases=NA),
     times="time",t0=-1/52,
     skeleton=open.sir.ode,
     skeleton.type="vectorfield",
     initializer=init,
     statenames=c("S","I","R"),
     paramnames=c("Beta","gamma","mu","S_0","I_0","N")
) -> open.sir


#' 
#' We'll need to specify a birth/death rate in addition to the two parameters we specified before:
## ----set-open-params-----------------------------------------------------
params <- c(mu=1/50,Beta=400,gamma=13,
            N=100000,S_0=100000/12,I_0=100)


#' We integrate the equations as before:
## ----solve-open-sir------------------------------------------------------
x <- trajectory(open.sir,params=params,as=TRUE)


#' 
#' We can plot each of the state variables against time, and $I$ against $S$:
#' 
## ----open-epi-plot,eval=T,fig.show='hold'--------------------------------
ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I))+geom_line()
ggplot(data=x,mapping=aes(x=S,y=I))+geom_path()


#' 
#' #### Exercise: exploring the model's dynamical repertoire
#' Explore the dynamics of the system for different values of the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters by simulating and plotting trajectories as time series and in phase space (e.g., $I$ vs. $S$).
#' Use the same values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we looked at above.
#' How does the value of $R_0$ affect the results?
#' 
#' #### Exercise: host lifespan
#' Under the assumptions of this model, the average host lifespan is $1/\mu$.  
#' Explore how host lifespan affects the dynamics by integrating the differential equations for lifespans of 20 and 200 years.
#' 
#' The compartmental modeling strategy can be put to use in modeling a tremendous range of infections.
#' The following exercises make some first steps in this direction.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: SIRS model
#' The SIR model assumes lifelong sterilizing immunity following infection.
#' For many infections, immunity is not permanent.
#' Make a compartment diagram for an SIRS model, in which individuals lose their immunity after some time.
#' Write the corresponding differential equations and modify the above codes to study its dynamics.
#' Compare the SIR and SIRS dynamics for the parameters $\mu=1/50$, $\gamma=365/13$, $\beta=400$ and assuming that, in the SIRS model, immunity lasts for 10 years.
#' 
#' 
#' #### Challenge: SEIR model
#' Make a diagram, write the equations, and study the dynamics of the SEIR model for the dynamics of an infection with a latent period.
#' Compare the dynamics of SIR and SEIR models for the parameters $\mu=1/50$, $\gamma=365/5$, $\beta=1000$ and assuming that, in the SEIR model, the latent period has duration 8 days.
#' 
#' 
#' ### Nonautonomous equations
#' 
#' #### SIR with seasonal transmission
#' 
#' The simple SIR model always predicts damped oscillations towards an equilibrium (or pathogen extinction if $R_0$ is too small). 
#' This is at odds with the recurrent outbreaks seen in many real pathogens. 
#' Sustained oscillations require some additional drivers in the model. 
#' An important driver in childhood infections of humans (e.g., measles) is seasonality in contact rates because of aggregation of children the during school term. 
#' We can analyze the consequences of this by assuming sinusoidal forcing on $\beta$ according to $\beta(t)=\beta_0\,(1+\beta_1\cos(2\,\pi\,t))$. 
#' We can modify the code presented above to solve the equations for a seasonally forced epidemic.
## ----seas-sir,cache=TRUE-------------------------------------------------
seasonal.sir.ode <- Csnippet("
  double Beta = beta0*(1+beta1*cos(2*M_PI*t));
  DS = -Beta*S*I/N+mu*(N-S);
  DI = Beta*S*I/N-gamma*I-mu*I;
  DR = gamma*I-mu*R;
")

pomp(open.sir,
     skeleton=seasonal.sir.ode,
     skeleton.type="vectorfield",
     initializer=init,
     statenames=c("S","I","R"),
     paramnames=c("beta0","beta1","gamma","mu","N","S_0","I_0")
     ) -> seas.sir

params <- c(mu=1/50,beta0=400,beta1=0.15,gamma=26,
            N=1e5,S_0=7000,I_0=50)

trajectory(seas.sir,params=params,as=TRUE) -> x
ggplot(x,mapping=aes(x=time,y=I))+geom_path()
ggplot(x,mapping=aes(x=S,y=I))+geom_path()


#' 
#' #### Exercise: exploration
#' Explore the dynamics of the seasonally forced SIR model for increasing amplitude $\beta_1$.
#' Be sure to distinguish between transient and asymptotic dynamics.
#' 
#' 
#' ## Feature-based parameter estimation
#' 
#' A classical approach to the estimation of parameters is to identify informative features of a dataset and then choose parameters in a model so as to match those features.
#' This *feature matching* approach is sometimes known as the *generalized method of moments* and is experiencing something of a revival in recent years.
#' Here, we give some examples of this approach in the specific context of a single epidemic curve, modeled as a closed SIR epidemic.
#' 
#' ### Estimating $R_0$ from the final size
#' 
#' For a simple, closed SIR outbreak, we can derive an expression that determines the *final size* of the outbreak, i.e., the total number of hosts infected.
#' To do this, note that if 
#' $\frac{dS}{dt}=-\frac{\beta S I}{N}$ and
#' $\frac{dI}{dt}=\frac{\beta S I}{N}-\gamma\,I$, then
#' $\frac{dI}{dS}=-1+\frac{N}{R_0\,S},$ which we integrate to yield
#' $$S(0)-S(\infty)+\frac{N}{R_0}\,\log{\frac{S(\infty)}{S(0)}}=I(\infty)-I(0)=0.$$
#' If $S(0)=N$, then $N-S(\infty)$ is the final size of the outbreak and the fraction ultimately infected is $f=1-\frac{S(\infty)}{N}$.
#' In terms of the latter, we have
#' $$R_0=-\frac{\log{(1-f)}}{f}.$$
#' 
#' The following shows the relationship between final size and $R_0$:
## ----final-size,echo=F---------------------------------------------------
f <- seq(0,1,length=100)
R0 <- -log(1-f)/f
plot(f~R0,type='l',xlab=expression(R[0]),ylab="fraction infected",bty='l')

#' 
#' ### Estimating $R_0$ in an invasion
#' 
#' During the early stages of an SIR outbreak, the number of infected individuals $I$ is approximately 
#' $$I\;\approx\;I_0\,e^{(R_0-1)\,(\gamma+\mu)\,t}$$
#' where $I_0$ is the (small) number of infectives at time $0$, $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ is the infectious period, and $\frac{1}{\mu}$ is the host lifespan.
#' Taking logs of both sides, we get
#' $$\log{I}\;\approx\;\log{I_0}+(R_0-1)\,(\gamma+\mu)\,t,$$
#' which implies that a semi-log plot of $I$ vs $t$ should be approximately linear with a slope proportional to $R_0-1$ and the recovery rate.
#' 
#' We can plot the 1977 boarding school influenza data [@Anonymous1978] in this way to see if this is the case.
#' 
## ----bbs-flu-------------------------------------------------------------
url <- "http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/stochsim/bsflu_data.txt"
bsflu <- read.table(url,header=TRUE)
plot(B~day,data=bsflu,type='b',bty='l',
     main='boarding school influenza outbreak',
     xlab='day',ylab='Influenza cases')

#' 
## ----bsflu-log-----------------------------------------------------------
plot(B~day,data=bsflu,type='b',log='y',bty='l',
     xlab='day',ylab='Influenza cases')

#' 
#' Plotted on a log scale, the linearity of the first several data points is indeed striking.
#' This suggests that we can obtain a cheap and cheerful estimate of $R_0$ by a simple linear regression:
## ----bbs-flu-lm,echo=T,results='markup'----------------------------------
fit <- lm(log(B)~day,data=subset(bsflu,day<=4))
summary(fit)
coef(fit)
slope <- coef(fit)[2]; slope

#' Now, we know that influenza's infectious period is about 2.5&nbsp;da.
#' Moreover, since this is far shorter than an average human life ($\mu\ll\gamma$), we can neglect $\mu$ in our estimating equation.
#' Thus our estimate of $R_0$ is 
#' $$\hat{R_{0}}\;=\;\mathrm{slope}/\gamma+1\;\approx\;{`r signif(slope,2)`}\times{2.5}+1\;\approx\;{`r signif(slope*2.5+1,2)`}.$$
#' 
#' Our strategy in this case has been to redefine the problem so that it fits a standard form, i.e., we showed how to rearrange the model so that the relevant quantity ($R_0$) could be obtained from linear regression. 
#' This means that all the usual diagnostics associated with linear regression are also available to check the fit of the model.
#' We can get a rough estimate of the uncertainty in our estimate by looking at the standard errors in our estimator.
## ----bbs-flu-se----------------------------------------------------------
coef(summary(fit))
slope.se <- coef(summary(fit))[2,2]
2.5*slope.se

#' So we reckon we've got an error of $\pm{`r signif(2.5*slope.se,1)`}$ in our estimate of $R_0$, i.e., we feel pretty confident that ${`r signif((slope-2*slope.se)*2.5+1,3)`}<R_{0}<{`r signif((slope+2*slope.se)*2.5+1,3)`}$.
#' 
#' A defect of this method is that it uses only a small amount of the data to compute an important quantity.
#' Moreover, we have to make a subjective judgement as to how much of the data to use.
#' Further, as we use more data, and presumably obtain more precise estimates, we simulataneously get further from the realm where our approximation is valid, which introduces greater bias.
#' Let's see how our estimates of $R_0$ depend on what we choose to be the "initial phase" of the outbreak.
#' Below, we estimate $R_0$ and its standard error using the first 2, 3, 4, ..., 10 data points.
#' We then plot these estimates with their uncertainties to show this precision-accuracy tradeoff.
#' 
## ----inv-R0-est,echo=F---------------------------------------------------
fitfn <- function (interval) {
  fit <- lm(log(B)~day,data=subset(bsflu,day<=interval))
  slope <- coef(summary(fit))[2,1]
  slope.se <- coef(summary(fit))[2,2]
  c(interval=interval,R0.hat=slope*2.5+1,R0.se=slope.se*2.5)
}
ldply(2:10,fitfn) -> ests
ggplot(ests,mapping=aes(x=interval,y=R0.hat,
                        ymin=R0.hat-2*R0.se,
                        ymax=R0.hat+2*R0.se))+
  geom_point()+geom_errorbar(width=0.2)+
  labs(x="length of initial phase",y=expression("estimated"~R[0]))

#' 
#' #### Exercise: measles in Niamey
#' 
#' Biweekly data for outbreaks of measles in three communities within Niamey, Niger [@Grais2006] are provided in the file `http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/parest/niamey.csv`.
#' To download and plot the data, do, e.g.,
#' 
## ----niamey-plot,eval=FALSE,warning=FALSE--------------------------------
## niamey <- read.csv("http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/parest/niamey.csv")
## ggplot(niamey,mapping=aes(x=biweek,y=measles,color=community))+
##   geom_line()+geom_point()

#' 
#' Use both the final-size and the invasion rate methods to obtain estimates of $R_0$ for measles using the data from each of the communities of Niamey, assuming that the infectious period is approximately two weeks.
#' 
#' ## Fitting deterministic dynamical epidemiological models to data
#' 
#' ### Least squares
#' 
#' Now we move on to a much more general but considerably more complicated technique for estimating $R_0$. 
#' The method of *least squares* gives us a way to quantify the discrepancy between the data and a model's predictions.
#' We can then search over all possible values of a model's parameters to find the parameters that minimize this discrepancy.
#' 
#' We'll illustrate this method using the Niamey data:
## ----niamey-plot,warning=FALSE-------------------------------------------
niamey <- read.csv("http://kingaa.github.io/short-course/parest/niamey.csv")
ggplot(niamey,mapping=aes(x=biweek,y=measles,color=community))+
  geom_line()+geom_point()

#' 
#' Since this is a single outbreak, and the number of births and deaths into the population over the course of the outbreak is small relative to the size of the population, we can treat this outbreak as if it were occurring in a closed population.
#' 
#' Thus far, we have only considered deterministic models.
#' In the next lab, we will begin to think about more realistic models that begin to take into account some aspects of the stochastic nature of real epidemics.
#' For now, under the assumption that the epidemic is deterministic, parameter estimation is a matter of finding the model trajectory that gives the best fit to the data.
#' The first thing we need is a function that computes a trajectory given parameters of the model.
## ----closed-sir-predictions----------------------------------------------
pomp(data=subset(niamey,community=="A",select=-community),
     times="biweek",t=0,
     skeleton=closed.sir.ode,
     skeleton.type="vectorfield",
     initializer=init,
     statenames=c("S","I","R"),
     paramnames=c("Beta","gamma","N","S_0","I_0")) -> niameyA
                
sse <- function (params) {
  x <- trajectory(niameyA,params=params)
  discrep <- x["I",,]-obs(niameyA)
  sum(discrep^2)
}

#' 
#' Now we set up a function that will calculate the sum of the squared differences (or errors) between the data and the model predictions.
#' 
#' To get a sense of what this gives us, let's explore varying some parameters and computing the SSE for community "A" of the Niamey data set.
#' To begin with, we'll assume we know that $\gamma=1$ and that the initial numbers of susceptibles, infectives, and recovereds, $X_0, Y_0, Z_0$ were 10000, 10, and 20000, respectively.
#' We'll write a little function that will plug a value of $\beta$ into the parameter vector and compute the SSE.
## ----sse-calc1,cache=T---------------------------------------------------
params <- c(Beta=NA,gamma=1,
            N=50000,S_0=10000,I_0=10)
f <- function (Beta) {
  params["Beta"] <- Beta
  sse(params)
}
beta <- seq(from=30,to=40,by=0.5)
SSE <- sapply(beta,f)

#' 
#' We take our estimate, $\hat{\beta}$ to be the value of $\beta$ that gives the smallest SSE,
## ----beta.hat,eval=T-----------------------------------------------------
beta.hat <- beta[which.min(SSE)]

#' and plot SSE vs.\ $\beta$:
## ----sse-vs-beta---------------------------------------------------------
plot(beta,SSE,type='l')
abline(v=beta.hat,lty=2)


#' 
#' What does the SIR model predict at $\beta=\hat{\beta}$?
#' We compute the model's trajectory to find out:
#' 
## ----sse-betahat---------------------------------------------------------
params["Beta"] <- beta.hat
coef(niameyA) <- params
x <- trajectory(niameyA,as.data.frame=TRUE)
dat <- join(as.data.frame(niameyA),x,by='time')
ggplot(dat,aes(x=time))+
  geom_line(aes(y=measles),color='black')+
  geom_line(aes(y=I),color='red')

#' 
## ----sse2----------------------------------------------------------------
beta <- seq(from=0,to=40,by=0.5)
SSE <- sapply(beta,f)
plot(beta,SSE,type='l')
beta.hat <- beta[which.min(SSE)]
abline(v=beta.hat,lty=2)
coef(niameyA,"Beta") <- beta.hat
x <- trajectory(niameyA,as.data.frame=TRUE)
dat <- join(as.data.frame(niameyA),x,by='time')
ggplot(dat,aes(x=time))+
  geom_line(aes(y=measles),color='black')+
  geom_line(aes(y=I),color='red')

#' 
#' 
#' #### Exercise: least-squares estimation of $R_0$
#' Use this method to obtain estimates of $R_0$ for measles from each of the three communities in Niamey.
#' You may again assume that the infectious period is two weeks.
#' 
#' 
#' Clearly, this fit leaves much to be desired, but recall that we've here assumed that we know the correct values for all parameters but $\beta$.
#' In particular, we've assumed we know the infectious period, and the initial conditions.
#' [NB: the initial value of $R$ is entirely irrelevant.  Why?]
#' Let's see what happens when we try to estimate two parameters at once.
## ----sse-calc2,cache=T---------------------------------------------------
grid <- expand.grid(Beta=seq(from=0,to=20,length=50),
                    S_0=seq(from=4000,to=20000,length=50),
                    N=50000,gamma=1,I_0=10)
x <- trajectory(niameyA,params=t(grid),as.data.frame=TRUE)
library(plyr)
join(x,as.data.frame(niameyA),by="time") -> x
ddply(x,~traj,summarize,sse=sum((measles-I)^2)) -> x
cbind(grid,x) -> grid


#' 
#' We can visualize this as a surface:
## ----sse-plot2,echo=F----------------------------------------------------
ggplot(data=grid,mapping=aes(x=Beta,y=S_0,z=sqrt(sse),fill=sqrt(sse)))+
         geom_tile()+geom_contour(bins=30)+
    labs(fill=expression(sqrt(SSE)),x=expression(beta),y=expression(S(0)))

#' 
#' #### Exercise: interpreting the shape of the likelihood surface
#' Discuss the shape of this surface: 
#' what does it tell us about the uncertainty in the model's parameters?
#' 
#' #### Challenge: SEIR model estimation
#' Repeat the estimation using a closed SEIR model.
#' Assume that the infectious period is 5&nbsp;da and the latent period is 8&nbsp;da.
#' How and why does your estimate of $R_0$ differ from that you obtained using the SIR model?
#' 
#' ### Optimization algorithms
#' 
#' When we have more than two parameters to estimate (as we usually will), we cannot rely on grid searches or simple graphical techniques to find the region of parameter space with the best parameters.
#' We need more systematic ways of searching through the parameter space.
#' Mathematicians have devoted much study to *optimization algorithms*, and there are many of these.
#' Many of them are implemented in **R**.
#' 
#' The first place to go is the function `optim`, which implements several common, well-studied, generally-useful optimization algorithms.
## ----eval=FALSE----------------------------------------------------------
## ?optim

#' To use it, we have to specify the function we want to *minimize* and a starting value for the parameters.
#' Starting from this point, `optim`'s algorithms will search the parameter space for the value that minimizes the value of our *objective function*.
#' 
#' We'll write an objective function to try to estimate $\beta$, $S_0$, and $I_0$ simultaneously.
#' For the moment, we'll continue to assume that the recovery rate $\gamma$ is known.
## ----sse-calc3,eval=T,cache=T,results='hide',warning=FALSE---------------
coef(niameyA) <- params
f <- function (par) {
  params[c("S_0","I_0","Beta")] <- par
  sse(params)
}
optim(fn=f,par=c(10000,10,8)) -> fit

## ----sse-calc3-show------------------------------------------------------
fit

#' 
#' #### Exercise: rescaling the data
#' In the foregoing, we've estimated parameters by minimizing the sum of squared differences between model-predicted number of cases and the data.
#' What would happen if we tried to minimize the squared error on the log scale, i.e., to minimize $(\log(\mathrm{model})-\log(\mathrm{data}))^2$?
#' What would happen if we minimized the squared error on the square-root scale, i.e., $(\sqrt{\mathrm{model}}-\sqrt{\mathrm{data}})^2$?
#' What's the "correct" scale to choose?
#' 
#' #### Challenge: four-parameter optimization
#' Try to estimate all four parameters at once.
#' Start your algorithm from several places to check that they all converge to the same place.
#' You may find it useful to restart the optimizer to verify its convergence.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: interpreting local optima
#' The above plot of SSE against $\beta$ shows a second local minimum of the SSE at a much higher value of $\beta$.
#' Why is this?
#' 
#' Many other optimization algorithms exist.
#' `optim` implements several of these (see `?optim`).
#' Other functions and packages you might look into include:
#' `constrOptim`, `optimx`, `nlm`, `nlminb`, `nloptr` (from the `nloptr` package), and `subplex` (from the `subplex` package).
#' 
#' ## The likelihood
#' 
#' We have seen that fitting mechanistic models to data is a powerful and general approach to estimating parameters.
#' We saw too that least-squares fitting, is a straightforward way to do this.
#' However, several issues arose.
#' First, there was an element of arbitrariness in the choice of discrepancy measure.
#' Second, although we could fairly easily obtain point estimates of model parameters using least-squares, it was not clear how we could obtain concomitant estimates of parameter uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals).
#' Finally, we began to see that there are limits to our ability to estimate parameters.
#' In this lab, we'll explore these issues, and see that likelihood offers an attractive resolution to the first and second of these, but that the third is a fundamental challenge.
#' 
#' Likelihood has many advantages:  
#' 
#' 1. fidelity to model  
#' 2. a deep and general theory  
#' 3. a sound theoretical basis for confidence intervals and model selection  
#' 4. statistical efficiency  
#' 
#' and some disadvantages: 
#' 
#' 1. fidelity to model  
#' 1. fragility (lack of robustness)  
#' 
#' ### Definition of likelihood
#' 
#' Likelihood is the *probability of a given set of data $D$ having occurred under a particular hypothesis $H$*: 
#' $$\mathcal{L}(H,D)=\prob{D|H}$$
#' 
#' A simple example: suppose $n$ individuals participate in a serological survey and $k$ of these individuals are found to be seropositive.
#' One parameter of interest is the true fraction, $p$, of the population that has seroconverted.
#' Assuming the sample was drawn at random and the population is large, then the probability of the data ($m$ of $n$ individuals seropositive) given the hypothesis that the true probability is $p$ is
#' $$\prob{D|H} = \binom{n}{k}\,p^k\,(1-p)^{n-k}.$$
#' 
#' If the true seroprevalence was, say, $p=0.3$, what does the probability of observing $k$ seropositives in a sample of size $n=50$ look like?
#' 
## ----binom-prob-plot-----------------------------------------------------
p <- 0.3
n <- 50
k <- seq(0,50,by=1)
prob <- dbinom(x=k,size=n,prob=p) 
plot(k,prob,type='h',lwd=5,lend=1,
     ylab="probability")

#' 
#' The likelihood is a function of the unknown parameters.
#' In this case, if we assume $n$ is known, then the likelihood is a function of $p$ alone:
#' $$\mathcal{L}(p) = \binom{n}{k}\,p^k\,(1-p)^{n-k}$$
#' Typically the logarithm of this function is more interesting than $\mathcal{L}$ itself.
#' Looking at this function for each of two different surveys:
## ----binom-lik-plot1,echo=T,eval=T---------------------------------------
k1 <- 18
n1 <- 50
p <- seq(0,1,by=0.001)
plot(p,dbinom(x=k1,size=n1,prob=p,log=TRUE),
     ylim=c(-10,-2),ylab="log-likelihood",
     type='l')
abline(h=dbinom(x=k1,size=n1,prob=k1/n1,log=TRUE)-
         0.5*qchisq(p=0.95,df=1),col='red')
abline(v=k1/n1,col='blue')

#' 
## ----binom-lik-plot2,echo=T,eval=T---------------------------------------
k2 <- 243
n2 <- 782
p <- seq(0,1,by=0.001)
plot(p,dbinom(x=k2,size=n2,prob=p,log=TRUE),
     ylim=c(-10,-2),ylab="log-likelihood",
     type='l')
abline(h=dbinom(x=k2,size=n2,prob=k2/n2,log=TRUE)-
         0.5*qchisq(p=0.95,df=1),col='red')
abline(v=k2/n2,col='blue')

#' 
#' In the above two plots, the likelihood is a function of the model parameter $p$.
#' Vertical lines show the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $p$.
#' Horizontal lines show the critical likelihoods for the likelihood ratio test at the 95% confidence level.
#' 
#' #### Exercise: interpreting the likelihood
#' How do the two curves just plotted differ from one another?
#' What features of the data are responsible for the differences?
#' 
#' ### From data points to data sets
#' 
#' Let's suppose we have three samples, $D_1, D_2, D_3$, taken by three different researchers, for the same large population.
#' If these samples are *independent*, then
#' $$\prob{D|H} = \prob{D_1|H}\times\prob{D_2|H}\times\prob{D_3|H},$$
#' which means that the likelihood of the full data set is the product of the likelihoods from each of the samples.
#' In other words, the likelihood gives a general recipe for combining data from different studies.
#' We'd compute the likelihood as follows:
## ----binom-lik2,results='markup'-----------------------------------------
n <- c(13,484,3200)
k <- c(4,217,1118)
dbinom(x=k,size=n,prob=0.2,log=TRUE)
sum(dbinom(x=k,size=n,prob=0.2,log=TRUE))
ll.fn <- function (p) {
  sum(dbinom(x=k,size=n,prob=p,log=TRUE))
}
p <- seq(0,1,by=0.001)
loglik <- sapply(p,ll.fn)
plot(p,loglik,type='l',ylim=max(loglik)+c(-10,0))

#' 
#' ### Fitting SIR to an epidemic curve using likelihood
#' 
#' Let us revisit the the case of measles in Niger.
#' We'll simplify the model slightly to eliminate some unnecessary and wasteful elements.
#' Our frequency-dependent SIR model, again, is
#' $$\begin{aligned}
#' \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\frac{\beta\,S\,I}{N}\\
#' \frac{dI}{dt} &= \frac{\beta\,S\,I}{N}-\gamma\,I\\
#' \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma\,I\\
#' \end{aligned}$$
#' Notice that
#' 1. the $R$ equation is irrelevant for the dynamics of the epidemic and we can drop it entirely, and
#' 1. $\beta$ only ever occurs in combination with $N$, so we can combine these two into a single parameter by defining $b=\beta/N$.
#' We can modify the **R** codes we used before to take account of this.
#' 
## ----closed-sir-model-defn-two-------------------------------------------
pomp(data=niameyA,
     skeleton=Csnippet("
  double incidence;
  incidence = b*S*I;
  DS = -incidence;
  DI = incidence-gamma*I;"),
     initializer=Csnippet("
  S = S_0;
  I = I_0;"),
     paramnames=c("b","gamma","S_0","I_0"),
     statenames=c("S","I")) -> niameyA
     

#' 
#' Earlier, we used sum of squared error (SSE) as a measure of the discrepancy between model predictions and data.
#' Now let's use likelihood instead.
#' Let's suppose that, when we record cases, we make errors that are normally distributed.
#' Here's how we can compute the log likelihood of the data given the model and its parameters:
#' 
## ----closed-sir-negloglik,eval=T-----------------------------------------
dat <- as.data.frame(niameyA)
loglik <- function (params) {
    x <- trajectory(niameyA,params=params)
    prediction <- x["I",,]
    sum(dnorm(x=dat$measles,mean=prediction,
              sd=params["sigma"],log=TRUE))
}

#' 
## ----loglik-calc1,cache=T------------------------------------------------
dat <- subset(niamey,community=="A")
params <- c(S_0=10000,I_0=10,gamma=1,b=NA,sigma=1)

f <- function (b) {
  par <- params
  par["b"] <- b
  loglik(par)
}

b <- seq(from=0,to=0.001,by=0.00002)
ll <- sapply(b,f)

#' 
#' We plot the results:
## ----b-hat-plot----------------------------------------------------------
plot(b,ll,type='l',ylab=expression(log(L)))
b.hat <- b[which.max(ll)]
abline(v=b.hat,lty=2)

#' 
#' The great similarity in the likelihood estimate to our first least-squares estimate is no accident.
#' Why is this?
#' Let $y_t$ be the observed number of infectives at time $t$ and $Y_t$ be the model's prediction.
#' Then the log likelihood is
#' $$\log\prob{y_t|Y_t} = \log{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\,\exp{\left(-\frac{(y_t-Y_t)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)}\right)} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\,\log{2\pi\sigma^2}-\tfrac{1}{2}\,\frac{(y_t-Y_t)^2}{\sigma^2}$$
#' and
#' $$\log\mathcal{L} = -\tfrac{1}{2}\,\left(\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\,\sum_{t}\!(y_t-Y_t)^2+\log{(\sigma^2)}+\log{(2\pi)}\right)$$
#' So MLE and least-squares are equivalent if the errors are normal with constant variance!
#' 
#' #### Exercise: log-normal errors
#' Suppose, alternatively, that the errors are log-normal with constant variance.
#' Under what definition of SSE will least-squares and maximum likelihood give the same parameter estimates?
#' 
#' ## Modeling the noise
#' 
#' ### Poisson errors
#' 
#' All this raises the question of what the best model for the errors really is.
#' Of course, the answer will certainly depend on the nature of the data.
#' The philosophy of likelihood encourages us to think about the question mechanistically.
#' When the data, $y_t$, are the result of a sampling process, for example, we can think of them as binomial samples
#' $$y_t\;\sim\;\dist{Binomial}{Y_t,\frac{n}{N}}$$
#' where $n$ is the sample size, $N$ the population size, and $Y_t$ is the true number of infections at time $t$.
#' Alternatively, we might think of $y_t$ as Poisson samples
#' $$y_t\;\sim\;\dist{Poisson}{p\,Y_t}$$
#' where the parameter $p$ reflects a combination of sampling efficiency and the detectability of infections.
#' The latter leads to the following log-likelihood function
#' 
## ----poisson-lik---------------------------------------------------------
poisson.loglik <- function (params) {
    x <- trajectory(niameyA,params=params)
    prediction <- x["I",,]
    sum(dpois(x=dat$measles,lambda=params["p"]*prediction,log=TRUE))
}


#' 
#' Let's see what the MLE parameters are for this model.
#' We'll start by estimating just one parameter.
#' Now, we must have $b>0$.
#' This is a *constraint* on the parameter.
#' One way to enforce this constraint is by transforming the parameter so that it cannot ever be negative.
#' We'll log-transform $b$ in writing our objective function, $f$.
#' Note that the objective function should return the negative log likelihood!
## ----fit-b,results='markup'----------------------------------------------
params <- c(S_0=20000,I_0=1,gamma=1,b=NA,p=0.2)

f <- function (log.b) {
  params[c("b")] <- exp(log.b) # un-transform 'b'
  -poisson.loglik(params)
}

#' 
#' For something new, we'll use the `mle2` function from the **bbmle** package to maximize the likelihood.
#' `mle2` will employ an iterative algorithm for maximizing the likelihood.
#' To get started, it needs an initial guess.
#' It's always a good idea to put a bit of thought into the guess.
#' Since $b=\beta/N=R_0/(\mathrm{IP}\,N)$, where $\mathrm{IP}$ is the infectious period,
#' and using guesses $R_0\,\approx\,15$, $\mathrm{IP}\,\approx\,14$&nbsp;da, and $N\,\approx\,50000$, we get $b\,\approx\,15/(14{\times}50000)\,\mathrm{da}^{-1}\approx{`r signif(15/14/50000*14,1)`}~\mathrm{biweek}^{-1}$.
#' 
## ----bbmle-one-----------------------------------------------------------
library(bbmle)
guess <- list(log.b=log(0.0003))

fit <- mle2(f,start=guess)
fit

#' 
#' We can get an idea about the uncertainty and in particular obtain confidence intervals using the *profile likelihood*.
#' To profile over a parameter, we fix the value of that parameter at each of several values, then maximize the likelihood over the remaining unknown parameters.
#' In **bblme**, this is quite easy to obtain.
#' 
## ----profile1------------------------------------------------------------
prof.b <- profile(fit)
plot(prof.b)

#' 
#' Now let's try to estimate both $b$ and the reporting probability $p$.
#' Since we have constraints on $p$ ($0 \le p \le 1$), we'll transform it as well.
#' For this, the *logit* function and its inverse are useful: 
#' $$\mathrm{logit}(p)=\log{\frac{p}{1-p}} \qquad \mathrm{expit}(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.$$
#' 
## ----fit-b-p,results='markup'--------------------------------------------
logit <- function (p) log(p/(1-p))    # the logit transform
expit <- function (x) 1/(1+exp(-x))   # inverse logit

f <- function (log.b, logit.p) {
  par <- params
  par[c("b","p")] <- c(exp(log.b),expit(logit.p))
  -poisson.loglik(par)
}

guess <- list(log.b=log(0.0001),logit.p=logit(0.2))
fit <- mle2(f,start=guess); fit

#' 
#' Now we must untransform the parameters:
#' 
## ----fit-b-p-mle---------------------------------------------------------
mle <- with(as.list(coef(fit)),c(b=exp(log.b),p=expit(logit.p))); mle

#' 
## ----profile2,cache=T,results='hide'-------------------------------------
prof2 <- profile(fit)
plot(prof2)

#' 
#' Let's make a contour plot to visualize the likelihood surface.
#' This time the objective function has to take a vector argument.
#' 
## ----contour2,cache=T----------------------------------------------------
f <- function (pars) {
  par <- params
  par[c("b","p")] <- as.numeric(pars)
  poisson.loglik(par)
}

ggplot(grid,aes(x=b,y=p,z=loglik,fill=loglik))+
  geom_tile()+geom_contour(binwidth=2000)

#' 
#' The scale over which the log likelihood is varying is clearly huge relative to what is meaningful.
#' Let's focus in on the region around the MLE.
#' 
## ----contour2-detail,cache=T---------------------------------------------

#' 
#' Let's look at the model's predictions at the MLE.
#' The model is a probability distribution, so we should look at a number of simulations.
#' An important question is: are the data a plausible sample from the predicted probability distribution?

#' ### Overdispersion: a negative binomial model
#' 
#' Clearly the Poisson model is not doing a very good job of capturing the pattern in the data.
#' Recall that, under the Poisson assumption, the variance of the error is equal to the mean.
#' It appears that we will need an error model that has the potential for more variability than does the Poisson.
#' The negative binomial distribution is such a distribution.
#' Let's explore the alternative assumption that $y_t$ is negative-binomially distributed with mean $p\,Y_t$, as before, but larger variance, $p\,Y_t\,(1+\theta\,p\,Y_t)$, i.e.,
#' $$y_t\;\sim\;\dist{Negbin}{\mathrm{mu}=p\,Y_t,\;\mathrm{size}=\frac{1}{\theta}}$$

#' 
#' What does this plot tell us?
#' Essentially, the deterministic SIR model, as we've written it, cannot capture the shape of the epidemic.
#' In order to fit the data, the optimization algorithm has expanded the error variance, to the point of absurdity.
#' The typical model realization (in blue) does not much resemble the data.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: three-parameter estimation
#' Try to estimate $p$, $b$, and $S(0)$ simultaneously.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: binomial errors
#' Reformulate the problem using the binomial error model.
#' Modify the parameter estimation codes appropriately, estimate the parameters, and comment on the results.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: modifying the mean-variance relationship
#' Reformulate the problem using a normal error model in which the variance is proportional to the mean:
#' $$y_t\;\sim\;\dist{Normal}{p\,I_t,\sigma\,\sqrt{I_t}}.$$
#' Modify the parameter estimation codes appropriately, estimate the parameters (including both $p$ and $\sigma$), and comment on the results.
#' 
#' #### Challenge: incidence
#' We've been treating the Niamey data as if they were direct---though inaccurate---measurements of the prevalence.
#' Actually, these are incidence data: they are measures of unique infections.
#' It would be more appropriate to model these data by adding another equation
#' $$\frac{dH}{dt} = \frac{\beta\,S\,I}{N}$$
#' to accumulate new infections and assuming the data are distributed according to, for example,
#' $$y_t\;\sim\;\dist{Poisson}{p\,(H_t-H_{t-1})}.$$
#' Modify the codes above to reflect these more appropriate assumptions, estimate the parameters, and comment on the results.
